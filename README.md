# Lorann

Developped by Loriciels in 1985. Lorann is a dungeon crawler, with monsters, scoring and death mecanics.
To pass levels you must collect the key in each level but take care of monsters.
You have to collect to kill monsters thanks to your fireball or gather fruits to increase your score.

-------------------------------

I developped my own version of Lorann during my studies. 
There is 4 kinds of mosnters with differents behaviours.
